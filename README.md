# SheCodes Weather Forecast Page

## Project Overview
This project is a weather forecast webpage, created as part of my learning journey with SheCodes. The page displays the current weather, along with the forecast for the next few days. This project was designed to practice HTML and CSS, focusing on layout design, styling elements, and creating a responsive user interface.

## Features
- Display of current weather in Tokyo with an appealing weather icon.
- Forecast for the upcoming days with temperature highs and lows.
- Hover effects for interactive user engagement.
- Responsive design for various device screens.
- A "Change City" button placeholder for future JavaScript functionality.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS

## Setup
To view the project, download the files and open the `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## Possible Improvements
- Implementation of JavaScript to fetch real-time weather data from an API.
- Adding functionality to the "Change City" button to allow users to search for and display weather in different locations.
- Incorporate a backend to store user preferences.

## Acknowledgments
- Thanks to the SheCodes Foundation for providing the opportunity to work on this project.
